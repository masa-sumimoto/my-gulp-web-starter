## About Editing Methods

### About Build
You need to edit files in `./src/*`.  
The files will be compiled as `dest/*`.  
While running the server, you can get compiled files for each save edit files.
Also, if you change the server startup method from `yarn run serve` to `yarn run serve --production`, you can get the minified styles and scripts for production.

You also can use `yarn run build` and `yarn run build --productioon` commands.  
These only compile. The server does not start.

### About Scripts
You need to save scripts to `./src/assets/javascripts/**/*.js`.  
The files will be compiled as `dest/assets/javascripts/bundle.js`.  
You can use ES6 and ES5 style. the scripts will be compiled as ES5.  
If you want to know the corresponding browser version, Please look `.browserlistrc`.

### About Styles
You need to save styles to `./src/assets/stylesheets/**/*.scss`.  
The files will be compiled as `dest/assets/stylesheets/bundle.scss`.  
This environment is intended to create web pages, and may not be suitable for creating web applications.
As a reason, the style is divided in the website specific context.

The following is the context of the style I suggest.  
`Core`, `Libralies`, `Layouts`, `Complex Parts`, `Primitive Parts`, `Pages` and `User`  
The sass stylesheets are defined accordingly.  

I also use Bootstrap a lot and prefer styles that override it.
If you don't like the style, Please remove styles in `src/assets/[dirname]/*.scss` and remove import lines of `src/assets/application.scss`. Design is possible in your style.

## About Images
You need to save images to `src/assets/images/**/*.{png, jpg, svg, gif}`.  
The files will be compiled as `dest/assets/images/**/*.{png, jpg, svg, gif}`.  
Your images are compressed automatically. ( and If your image is `jpg` or `png`, You can also get `webp` image. )  
If you don't want to compress images, Please add `__` to image name as prefix. like `__foo.png`. The image is not compressed.
